TILE
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[f] for focus tileset on selected tile

select area on tileset and [ctrl][c/x] will cut/copy tiles for moving around on tileset. cannot paste to map just yet. (**but can fill with selection and [t], see below)
disables tileset selection and draws a transparent red/green box over copy/cut tiles until pasted. pastes at new selected tile.

[u][d][l][r] select next/previous tile

[middle click] = selection tool / deselect (also [shift][leftclick])
[rightclick] = eyedropper / copy selection (also [ctrl][leftclick])
[leftclick] = draw / move selection
if left-drag selection, moves
if right-drag selection, copies

if [select tiles] and [double right click] opens MULTIPLE TILE EDITOR



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAP
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[pgup][pgdwn] Next/previous Map.


------------------
Standard functions
------------------

[middle click] = selection tool / deselect (also [shift][leftclick])

[rightclick] = eyedropper / copy selection (also [ctrl][leftclick])

[leftclick] = draw / move selection

[left-drag selection] Swaps selection.
[right-drag selection] Copies (overwrites) selection.

[ctrl][c/x/v] = Copy/cut/paste selection. (Cut and paste will swap.)
[a][ctrl][c/x/v] = Copy/cut/paste selection all layers.

[del] Deletes selection.
[a][del] Deletes all layers

------------------
Undo/Redo
------------------
[ctrl][z] / [ctrl][y] Does undo/redo for map operations, sort of buggy so dont rely on it. There are a few undo levels but they wrap around and skip levels.
Need to fix this, but it should work in a pinch.
This should work for MTE and Sprite Editor as well.

------------------
zooming in and out
------------------

[+/-] Or [mouse wheel up/down] = Zoom in/out

If area is selected, zoom will focus on the selection.

[l] = Holding [l] and selecting an area will set a "Zoom Lock". Holding [l] and middle-clicking anywhere will disable it.
If a "Zoom Lock" exists, zooming in and out will focus on this. (If there is not a normal selection)
This is handy for working on very large maps and keeping the focus on the area you are working on.

------------------
Selecting Layers
------------------
[`]-[0], [F1]-[F5] = Select layer 0-10, special layers.
*also works with numpad

[a] = Select all layers (Can ctrl-c/v copy/paste, right drag copy, left drag swap, double click make new tiles from all layers)

------------------
Toggling Layers
------------------
[ctrl][`/1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/0] Turn on/off layer 0-10
[ctrl][F1-F5] Turn on/off special layers (sprite, hit, camera, light mask, light, action)

[ctrl][shift][layer] Will "solo" that layer.  If the layer is off, it will turn all others off and that one on.
If the layer is currently on, it will turn all the other layers on and that one off.

------------------
Editing a group of tiles
------------------
If [select tiles] on map and [double RIGHT click], opens "Multiple Tile Editor" with the selected Map tiles combined in a single image.
Be careful, editing these tiles will edit their corresponding tiles in the tileset. 

If [select tiles] on map and [CTRL][double RIGHT click], opens MTE with the selected tiles COPIED into NEW tiles and appended at the bottom of the tileset.
*Careful! This automatically replaces the tiles that were selected on the map as well!
This is for quickly making new tiles from what's already there.


If you want to make a whole new group of tiles with all the layers COMBINED, hold [a]. (See next note.)

------------------
Making and editing combined tiles on all layers
------------------
If [select tiles] on map and hold [a] and [double RIGHT click], all enabled layers will be MERGED into completely NEW tiles, appended to the bottom of the tileset.
These tiles then open in MTE. Useful for making totally new tiles really easily!
*Includes Shadow layers, does NOT include disabled layers, special layers (hit/camera/action/sprite/light/lightmask/shader)
*Note this does not replace those tiles on the map, this must be done manually, or you can use [m] for this.



------------------
Filling the Map from the Tile Canvas
------------------
[t] Will fill the map selection with the selected tile.
If there is a group of tiles selected on the tile panel, it will fill it with that selection!

------------------
Merging tiles
------------------
[m] Merge all selected tiles on enabled layers into the bottom enabled layer. Makes new tiles. 
Useful for making solid 1-layer tile objects out of many layers (couches, etc)
*Skips shadow layers, disabled layers, and special layers.

------------------
Outputting textures
------------------
[n] output selected tiles to texture for import into google sketchup. mashes all visible layers and 2x sizes them. 
includes shadow layers, skips special layers (hit, shader, action, sprite)

------------------
Moving Tiles up and down a layer
------------------
"["
"]"For moving selected tiles up and down a layer.
*Doesnt overwrite existing tiles. 
*Skips shadow and fx layers.
*Doesn't care if target layer is enabled or not!

------------------
Merging tiles to Shadow Tiles
------------------
[s] selection on all enabled layers will be combined to new tiles, masked to all black, FLIPPED upside down, and placed at the BOTTOM of the selection.
this is for making quick shadows. *MUST have shadow layer selected. skips disabled layers, special layers.





------------------
[Use Map Canvas Layer Buffer]
------------------
usually each layer is generated on-the-fly and drawn to a single buffer image.
this option stores each layer as a separate buffer image, so actions that need to redraw all layers are much faster- such as turning layers on and off.
it uses a lot of ram on very large maps, as it is storing 12 bitmaps in memory.

------------------
[Sprite Layer]
------------------
[Right click] on map to place a sprite from the Sprite Editor.
[Click] to select a placed sprite, [click and drag] to move, hold [ctrl] to copy it. press [delete] to delete.
[Double click] to open Info Window.
*There is an option to move Map Sprites by pixels or tiles in the Sprite Menu.

------------------
[Light Mask Layer]
------------------
Light mask layer will block all light from the light layer.
It can use any tile, which will show as transparent orange.
This is for masking out walls, objects, and areas that you don't want affected by a light source.

------------------
[Light Layer]
------------------
[Select] an area and [double click] on it to open the Light Editor window.
Select a light by [clicking] on the center of it. [Double click] to open editor.
Select a light and [drag] to move it, hold [ctrl] to copy it. Press [delete] to delete.

------------------
[Action Layer]
------------------
[Select] an area and [double click] on it to open the Action Editor Window.
[Click and drag] to move. [Delete] to delete.
[Double click] to open editor again.
If it is enabled as a door, it will have an arrival point marker. [Click] to select the action and then [click and drag] to set the arrival point.




----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PALETTE
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[numpad +/-] Next/previous Palette color

[shift]->[left click drag] on palette moves colors.
right click drag on palette copies them.
[shift]->[a]->[left click drag] moves colors for all tileset palletes, be careful. (used if sorting identical palettes)

now palette uses HSV along with RGB, can easily make darker/lighter shades by adjusting v

[ctrl][F4] sort palette by gray then HSV, can do many times for different effects.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MULTIPLE TILE EDITOR/SPRITE EDITOR
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[+/-] == [mouse wheel up/down] = zoom in/out

[middle click] = selection tool / deselect (also [shift][leftclick])
[rightclick] = eyedropper / copy selection (also [ctrl][leftclick])
[leftclick] = draw / move selection
if left-drag selection, moves
if right-drag selection, copies

[ctrl][c/x/v] = copy/cut/paste selection
[del] deletes selection.

[ctrl][f] flip vertical
[ctrl][r] reverse horizontal

[ctrl][z] does undo, sort of buggy so dont rely on it. theres a few undo levels but they wrap around and skip levels

Sprite editor
[a][s] back/forward frame
[pgup][pgdown] next/previous sprite.

[h] set hitbox offsets from selection box
[u] set utility point from selection box upper left corner

TO COPY TILES FROM ONE TILESET TO ANOTHER
can open MultiTileEditor, copy, keep MultiTileEditor open [switch tilesets] and paste. make sure tiles are blank!
colors will be screwed up unless palette values are identical
