replace color with color

select all in mte/sprite editor ctrl-a

paste non-zero ctrl-shift-v (paste bitmask)
 * 
only copy enabled layers a-ctrl-shift-c

fill undo on load map

redo faster 

paste into selection from tileset

sprite editor lay out frames in grid

need random sprite output.

also need to import bmp to tiles that would be nice

palette synchronize for all tilesets (sort add colors.. easy)
need merge maps/tilesets/palettes into one.

make undo better/not wrap around/skip

move map up/down

need to change gfx.h output to not use tileset names at all
this requires me to change the map define output, the pal bin output, the touchmap png output
the prototypes and declarations output
hmm dont even need map declarations anymore everything is pafs

pull off tile panel/ control panel. dockable?

drawing/moving/filling/copy/paste tiles REALLY SLOW with sprite layer on and lots of Sprites.
support npc identifiers?
need mapsprite defines to show up in function editor without saving twice.
